## Project Objective

Addressing the growing prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles, there is an increasing need for a shift towards healthier habits. While many aspire to improve their lifestyles, the challenge lies in taking action amid busy schedules or forgetfulness. This project aims to provide a tool functioning as a method of monitoring their daily habits, facilitating the process of cultivating healthier routines. The primary objective is to serve as a self-reflection tool, accommodating commitments ranging from small tasks like making the bed daily to more significant ones such as frequenting the gym. Additional goals include recording daily habits, tracking progress, sending reminders, fostering friendly competition through leaderboards, and promoting long-term goals. The significance of a habit tracker lies in enhancing self-awareness, promoting accountability, offering motivation through progress visualization, and contributing to efficient time management for a more organized and productive lifestyle.
