# HabitConnect

Introducing HabitConnect, an online platform serving as a personal growth coach, designed to cultivate positive habits and monitor individual progress. It empowers users to establish and pursue personal development goals, including daily streaks, reminders, motivational quotes, and engaging group challenges, ensuring users stay motivated and on course.

The application prioritizes user-friendliness and ease-of-use. It offers the option to create an account linked to an email for personalized tracking and use from any device. Logging habit and to-do completion is seamless, with a comprehensive statistics page to track personal progress. For those seeking a competitive edge, creation and participation in group challenges allows users to gauge their progress against others and encourage their friends to extend their streak!

Operating under Agile software development principles, the project, led by a team of 7—including the Scrum Master, Product Owner, Project Manager, and the development team, will closely collaborate with stakeholders to ensure all user requirements are achieved in their entirety by project deadlines. This is a culminating project for the COSC 4P02 course at Brock University.

## Project Objective

Addressing the growing prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles, there is an increasing need for a shift towards healthier habits. While many aspire to improve their lifestyles, the challenge lies in taking action amid busy schedules or forgetfulness. This project aims to provide a tool to monitor their daily habits, facilitating the process of creating and maintaining healthier routines. The primary objective is to serve as a self-reflection tool, accommodating any commitments provided by the user. Examples range from small tasks like making the bed daily to more significant ones such as frequenting the gym. Additional goals include recording daily habits, tracking progress, reminder notifications, fostering friendly competition through leaderboards, and promoting long-term goals. The significance of a habit tracker lies in enhancing self-awareness, promoting accountability, offering motivation through progress visualization, and contributing to efficient time management for a more organized and productive lifestyle.
